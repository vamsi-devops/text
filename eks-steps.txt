AWS EkS integration with AWS CodePipeline 

1)create an ECR Repository copy ECR URI aand copy the url in the Buildspec.yml in the github repository




2)create a build project in CodeBuild , in this you have to create a new service role and
   make sure that the service role has  EC2 Registry full access policy
here we will have builspec.yml 




3)Before going to CodeDeploy you have to launch Redhat/Ubuntu EC2 instance in which you have 
  to install AWS CLI 2.0 version and ruby and install code deploy agent and also give
 adminrole permission  to that ec2 instance

you have to install these below commands in ec2 instance 

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install awscli
   sudo apt-get install ruby2.0
   cd /home/ubuntu
   sudo aws s3 cp s3://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1/latest/install . --region us-east-1
   sudo chmod +x ./install
   sudo ./install auto


4) coming to CodeDeploy you have to create a Application &
         deployment group here we will have Appspec.yml

it takes 15 minutes above for creation of cluster if we want to check whether the cluster is creating
go to create cluster.yml  
so i have given the region eu-west-3(paris) in this my cluster will form with the name basic-cluster1



5) Now,  create a Pipeline in which source,Build ,deploy  the deployement is done to ec2 instances 



Thankyou :)
